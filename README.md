# Install Instructions

The bot requires the following to work:
- ffmpeg
- yt-dlp (The bot should install this for you.)
- git
- Node.JS 16.9.0+ and npm 8.0.0+
- Python 3.7+ (for yt-dlp to work)

If you're running the bot on Linux, install the following packages:
- `make`
- `gcc`
- `clang`
- `g++`

> ⚠️ If you're running the bot on Windows, the VS Build Tools are required, specifically Desktop Development with C++ module. This is included when installing Node.JS for the first time. If for any reason they were not installed, you can install it from the Visual Studio installer. You can download the installer from the direct link [here](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vs_BuildTools.exe). **You do not need to install Visual Studio itself, just the build tools.**

## Directions
1. Clone this repo.
2. Create a bot application [here](https://discord.com/developers), and copy the bot's token.
3. Fill out the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`
4. Type `npm ci` to install the dependencies.
5. Type `npm run bot` or `node index` to run the bot. (Consider using a process manager like PM2 to keep it running in the background.)
